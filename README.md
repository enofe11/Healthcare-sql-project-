# Healthcare-sql-project-
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a hospital management database to uncover meaningful insights related to **appointments**, **doctor productivity**, **revenue**, **billing**, **insurance usage**, and **patient behavior**. 
The analysis was done using SQL queries to address key business and operational questions that can support better decision-making within the hospital.
